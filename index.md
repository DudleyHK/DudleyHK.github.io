### Portfolio & Blog Site

`A space to put my latest projects, prototypes and research. The format and layout fo the site will change and grow as more content is added.` 


As a creative software developer and designer I am inspired by the world both when solving problems and thinking of new ideas.. Through out my career so far I have been drawn towards the uses of Artificial Intelligence to design simulations in Game environments. I found this passion in the first year of University I shared a broad AI module with other courses and later developed as I had the opportunity to create a partical swarm optimisaiton simulation and water simulation. These projects gave me a great foundation and understanding of the application of simualtions in video games and subsequently lead me to developing a Crowd Simulation for Evidential Ltd.

Developing a Crowd Simulation in Unity has consisted of multiple disaplines, designing Mecanim and Animation Blend Trees, using Unity's new Data-Oriented Tech Stack (DOTS) and Entity Component System (ECS) as well as reseraching Reciprocal Velocity Obstacles (RVO) utilising A* Pathfinding Project. Additionally, there are two main editors built with Unity Editor API, one for scene view per Agent visualisation and Debugging and the other for a Motive Driven Goal Selector plugin which helps the designer to build goal output for the crowd. 

The Motive Driven Goal Selector is a system that utilises Utility Functions to determine which Goal output is the best, based on a set of Motive values which are shaped by environmental factors.

I am hugely passionate about the health of the planet and humanity in so many capacities. My ultimate goal is to use my knowledge of technology and he transferable skills I have to create projects which will be benifitical to a greater cause. I understand that to get there many steps will need to be taken and I know that I am driven enough to work towards this goal.
